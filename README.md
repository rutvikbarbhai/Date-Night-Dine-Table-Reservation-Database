A streamlined database system for managing restaurant table reservations — ensuring efficiency, availability, and a smooth booking experience.   
## ✨ Problem Statement 
Date Night Dine aims to solve the problem restaurants face in earning more during evenings, especially for romantic dinners. Many restaurants find it hard to bring in couples for date nights, which leaves tables empty and reduces income. Date Night Dine gives them a platform to show their place as a perfect spot for romantic evenings by highlighting food, vibe, and location. With better visibility and easy reservations, it helps restaurants get more couples, more bookings, and make the most of their evening dining.
